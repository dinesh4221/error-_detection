# Error Detector Using Hamming Code-Verilog

## Overview
This project implements an Error Detection and Correction system using Hamming Code in Verilog.
Hamming codes are widely used in Computer Networks, Digital Communication, and Memory Systems to ensure reliable data transmission by detecting and correcting single-bit errors.

This Verilog design takes a binary input, generates its Hamming Code, and detects/corrects errors in the received data.
## Features
- Detection of single-bit errors.
-Correction of single-bit errors automatically.
-Identification of error-free data.
-Synthesizable Verilog design (works on FPGA/ASIC).
